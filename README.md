# bF - A small collection of VCV Rack plugins.


Greetings!

The appearance of VCV Rack has given me an opportunity to (finally!) learn some C++ while indulging my love of synthesis, especially the dream of working in the modular realm!

I have no background in DSP programming, but I am working on a more complex module that may (or may not...) change that!

For now, feel free to try out these basic modules while I continue to learn and code more when I have the time.

Right now, there are just a few:

 * _Oscillator_ - Just an implementation of the Template code to get me started.
 * _Multiple_ - A one-to-eight port Multiple.
 * _Sum_ - An eight-to-one sum.
 * _Quadrature_ - A more ambitious attempt to emulate a well-known hardware module. All of its functionality is just a guess at an implementation of the real thing...

Currently, I have only tested on Mac OS X (High Sierra). I have access to Linux and will test there when I can find the time. Alas, I don't "do" Windows...

__Feedback is welcome!__
